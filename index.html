        <p>
            Rubber baby buggy bumpers! I've replaced them both as the de facto
            patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have
            accepted me if I came home without you and your sister, so now you know
            the real reason I rescued you. I just took over the family, Morty! And
            if you tell your mom or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it, and
            they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty! And now you're gonna
            have to go and do whatever I say, Morty! Forever! An-and I-I-I'll go out
            and I'll find some more of that Mulan szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce,
            Morty! Th-b-because that's what this is all about Morty! Th-that's my
            one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty, that
            was fake! I-I-I'm driven by finding that mcnuggut sauce! I want that
            Mulan mcnuggut sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty! If it takes
            nine seasons, I want my mcnuggut dipping sauce szechuan sauce, Morty!
            That's what's gon-it's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty!
            Season nine more seasons, Morty! Nine more seasons until I get that
            dipping szechuan sauce! For ninety-seven more years, Morty! I want that
            mcnuggut sauce Morty! Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry! Sorry I didn't
            listen to you and tried to kill the whole world and stuff. Guess I gotta
            learn how to live in the moment a little more.

            Principal poop here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in
            charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I
            don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu,
            stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You
            don't bring dead babies to Passover. Aw, geez. God? God's turning people
            into insect monsters Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me.
            That's Right Morty! This is gonna be a lot like that. Except you know.
            It's gonna make sense.
