                Rubber baby buggy bumpers! I've replaced them both as the de facto
                patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have
                accepted me if I came home without you and your sister, so now you know
                the real reason I rescued you. I just took over thee family, Morty! And
                if you tell your mom or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it, and
                they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty! And now you're gonna
                have to go and do whatever I say, Morty! Forever! An-and I-I-I'll go out
                and I'll find some more of that Mulan szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce,
                Morty! Th-b-because that's what this is all about Morty! Th-that's my
                one-armed man!
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty, that
                was fake! I-I-I'm driven by finding that mcnuggut sauce! I want that
                Mulan mcnuggut sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty! If it takes
                nine seasons, I want my mcnuggut dipping sauce szechuan sauce, Morty!
                That's what's gon-it's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty!
                Season nine more seasons, Morty! Nine more seasons until I get that
                dipping szechuan sauce! For ninety-seven more years, Morty! I want that
                mcnuggut sauce Morty! Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry! Sorry I didn't
                listen to you and tried to kill the whole world and stuff. Guess I gotta
                learn how to live in the moment a little more.
