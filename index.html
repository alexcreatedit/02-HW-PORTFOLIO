                Rubber baby buggy bumpers! I've replaced them both as the de facto
                patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have
                accepted me if I came home without you and your sister, so now you know
                the real reason I rescued you. I just took over thee family, Morty! And
                if you tell your mom or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it, and
                they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty! And now you're gonna
                have to go and do whatever I say, Morty! Forever! An-and I-I-I'll go out
                and I'll find some more of that Mulan szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce,
                Morty! Th-b-because that's what this is all about Morty! Th-that's my
                one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty, that
                was fake! I-I-I'm driven by finding that mcnuggut sauce! I want that
                Mulan mcnuggut sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty! If it takes
                nine seasons, I want my mcnuggut dipping sauce szechuan sauce, Morty!
                That's what's gon-it's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty!
                Season nine more seasons, Morty! Nine more seasons until I get that
                dipping szechuan sauce! For ninety-seven more years, Morty! I want that
                mcnuggut sauce Morty! Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry! Sorry I didn't
                listen to you and tried to kill the whole world and stuff. Guess I gotta
                learn how to live in the moment a little more.

                Principal poop here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in
                charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I
                don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu,
                stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You
                don't bring dead babies to Passover. Aw, geez. God? God's turning people
                into insect monsters Beth. I'm the one beating ddddthem to death. Thank me.
                That's Right Morty! This is gonna be a lot like that. Except you know.
                It's gonna make sense.
            </p>
