# 02-HW-PORTFOLIO

# I first started with the foundation on the site. Initially I began to plug my elements in on my index.html page.
# Second I plugged in my links
# The header and banner were done first, it was the body that gave me the most trouble.
# Orginally I seperated my (About me, Work and Contact Me) I put those three things in their own area which consumed some of the left side.
# The issue I had with that for days were that I couldn't get the border right to stay seperate and for the wording to go down the entire page, which would of resulted the text being next to the elements to the right.
# I study some more, and chatted in to get some help from a tutor. I was given a column organizer page found on W3 schools. 
# I had seen this page eariler in my attempt to complete this homework assignment but failed. 
# Today after some more youtube videos, help from the tutor and help from my research I feel like I grasped a better concept of how to do what I wanted.
# After that I ended up seperating the elements in three rows. 
# I had trouble with my hovers and did not want to turn in late.
# I was told by my instructor Leah that, "Perfection is the enemy of completion." Given that I turned in what I could get done. 
# I understand flex box, but struggled the most with organizing on the page the way I wanted to. I will continue to work on that.
# However, I was happy that I could get the nav bar and my contact me elements to look the way I wanted them to. 
# Overall a very frustrating try, I wanted to give up. But glad I did not.
